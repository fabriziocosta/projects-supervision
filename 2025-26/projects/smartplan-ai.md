# SmartPlanAI: Automating Visual Validation of Planning Documents with Deep Learning

## Project Summary

**IEG4** and **Agile Applications**, part of the **IEG Group**, develop cutting-edge digital solutions tailored to the **Public Sector** and **Healthcare**. Supporting over 180 organisations, they streamline services from urban planning to healthcare management.

Among these, the **planning application process** remains a resource-intensive task for local councils, requiring meticulous validation of architectural diagrams and site plans.

This project proposes the development of an **AI-powered visual validator** that can automatically detect and highlight three critical elements in planning documents:

* **North Orientation Symbol**
* **Scale Bars**
* **Red Site Boundary Lines**

These elements are essential for proper planning validation but often vary in design and format, making manual verification **time-consuming and error-prone**.

## Project Objectives

* **Automate the identification** of key visual markers in planning documents submitted via the UK Planning Portal.
* **Reduce manual workload** for council planning officers by offloading routine checks to a deep learning-based object detector.
* **Improve speed and consistency** of the validation stage in urban planning workflows.

---

## Technical Scope

The project will involve:

* **Curating and preprocessing** a dataset of architectural and site plans.
* Using **deep learning object detection models** (e.g., **YOLOv8**, **Faster R-CNN**) trained to detect:

  * North symbols of varying styles
  * Scale bars in diverse formats
  * Red boundary lines with consistent shape but inconsistent thickness and colour shades
* Designing a **bounding-box visual output interface** to highlight detected features.
* **Evaluating performance** using metrics such as **precision**, **recall**, and **Intersection-over-Union (IoU)**.
* *(Optional)*: Integration into a **web-based tool** for real-world deployment and demonstration.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, students will:

* Gain **hands-on experience in computer vision and deep learning** using real-world public sector data.
* Develop skills in **data annotation**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.
* Learn to **translate practical challenges into deployable AI solutions** for civic technology.
* Understand how to **collaborate with stakeholders** in urban planning and digital governance.

## Real-World Impact

This project has **immediate applicability in the public sector**, directly aiding the **digitisation of local government planning workflows**. It offers students the opportunity to **contribute to societal benefit through technology**â€”streamlining processes that affect **housing, infrastructure, and community development**.
